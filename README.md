This repository stores all the code for the University at Buffalo's particpation in the University Nanosat-8 program, funded by the Airforce Research Lab and NASA. 

#Overview
Our satelitte, the Glint Analyzing Data Observation Satellite (GLADOS), is scheduled to be launched in 2017 by NASA. All work is done by UB students. Our flight-side software is written in C, and our ground station in Python. Due to export laws, all code here is private, but if you're interested in contributing to the development of GLADOS, our satellite, stop by Bell 250.
