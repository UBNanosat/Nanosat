This organization stores all the code for the University at Buffalo's Nanosatellite Laboratory, UBNL. 

# Overview
We're a group of UB students that work on the software for the various satellites UBNL is currently developing. Our flight-side software framework is written in C++, and our mission control software in Python. By demand of the AFRL, all software on this page is private, but if you're interested in contributing to the development of UBNL software, stop by Hochstetter 333.
